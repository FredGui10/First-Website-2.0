      <h1>Finding Community</h1>
      <p class="meta">Published: <time datetime="2025-09-08">Sept 8, 2025</time> • Hamburg</p>

      <p>At first, I felt very alone in a new city. The language, the rules, and the streets were all unfamiliar. But step by step, I started to find people who made Hamburg feel less cold.</p>

      <p>It began at a community center where volunteers organized German classes. There, I met others who were also starting their lives over. We laughed at our mistakes, shared food, and exchanged stories from our homes.</p>

      <p>Slowly, Hamburg started to feel more like home — not because of the buildings, but because of the people who reached out with kindness. This taught me that belonging doesn’t come overnight, but with connection.</p>
